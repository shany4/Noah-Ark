# Noah_Ark

- Orientation: The idea of the game is based on the “game of pass the river”. It is a very popular riddle game in China couple years ago. I wanted try to make a game just like that (I will post a link of the English version of that game below). The first thing I did was to design the game, because I cannot just copy the original game. In my game, there were eight characters. They were one employer with two workers, one professor with two students and one police with one prisoner. They have to move from land to the Noah Ark, in order to get rid of the great disaster in 2012 (The idea is from the movie “2012”). There was only one boat, and each time it could only move at most two people, and only professor, employer and police were able to drive the boat. However, prisoner would hurt people when police leave, the employer would enforce students to work when the professor leave and the professor would enforce worker to study when employer leave. Player had to figure out how to put all characters from land to the ark in a limited time. I also tried to design the background, and all characters by me self. Even though it was lots of work, I really had fun and learned a lot from it.

- Image & Music: I made all the images in for my game except the water. I used the Illustrator to draw my characters and used the Photoshop to design my background images. In order to make my game to be more dynamic and vivid, I decided to use the gif image for my water part. I tried my best to create the gif image in the Photoshop for the water, but I could never got an ideal image. Finally, I edited an icon in Photoshop that from Microsoft Word to be my water part. Since the space was limited and it was very hard to draw the picture by mouse, I just drew the face rather than the whole body for my characters. In fact, the big face was easier for people to recognize the identity of each characters. I used the “Iron Horse” form "Royalty-Free Music" for the background music of my game. I did not write a lot of code for my audio, I just add it in the HTML rather than javascript.

- Function: I used a lot of functions in this assignment. All the functions codes were inside the javascript. There were four big areas of function in my game, which were time & Pedometer function, initialization function, selection & click function and movement function. Each function defined and controlled specific part of the game, and related with others. I called the function out side of the javascript in HTML (body). The function really helped me to organize my code and made very thing easy and brief. I put many things in the function that included loops and objects.

- Object: I tried to write a few objects in the code of my game. The object was extremely useful for my game, especially for the “people selection” part. I learned how to use the object from class, and developed it from book and some online tutorials. For my game, most of the objects were from the javascript, they help me to achieve some event and domination. I thought that the object really helped me to organize my code and made everything much easier for me.

- CSS: In the game project, I used the CSS style to build the whole frame. I believed that the CSS was much better for me to build the frame of the game than the javacript. I learned CSS when I was in the first year at multimedia 1B03 class. I used the CSS to build eight different blocks in the game. Each block represented a specific individual part. I just defined the size, color and other parameters for each block of my game. They were clear also easy and safe to change.

- Multi-page: I tried to build multi-page website for my game. I saw that most of professional website game have move than one page. They always had one page for introduce the game, and one page gave the rule of the game and one page for the background or the producer of the game. Since, I learned how to make the multipage of web page and the link in the fist year multimedia class, I thought it would be cool to make my game more professional. I added an extra page for the home page, which introduced my game. I also add a Facebook target in homepage of my game, (use the Facebook developer code: iframe) which made my game even more professional.

- Timer & Pedometer: I added a timer and a pedometer in my game. Those two elements were very useful in my game. It limited the time of the game and made the game be more interesting and playable. I found time counting event code from “W3school” and add an alert my myself. However, it was so ugly. Finally my friend gave to me a timer & pedometer program that made by him in the past.
